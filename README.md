This is a simple implementation of A* pathfinding algorithm in Unity 2018.4 LTS


#### Mouse Controls

* LMB on grid to place selected type of cell
* RMB on grid to remove placed sell
* Mouse wheel to scale map view

#### UI Controls

* "Start point", "End point" and "Wall" switches are belongs to the same toggle group and represents current selected type of placeable cell
* "Allow Diagonal Move" switch allows algorithm to check cell neighbors that lays in both different X & Y coordinates relative to the current cell
* "Show Checked Cells" switch enables color change for cells that were checked by algorithm during pathfinding process
